# CNN-Image-Classification
### Summary of the Model
In this image classification model, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was employed to categorize images of five celebrities: Lionel Messi, Maria Sharapova, Roger Federer, Serena Williams, and Virat Kohli. The model architecture consists of several Conv2D layers with ReLU activation, MaxPooling layers for downsampling, Dropout for regularization, and Dense layers for the final classification. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, and accuracy is used as the evaluation metric.
### Training Process
The training process involves loading and preprocessing images of five different celebrities (Lionel Messi, Maria Sharapova, Roger Federer, Serena Williams, and Virat Kohli) from the specified directory. The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the "train_test_split" function from scikit-learn. The images are then normalized by scaling pixel values to the range [0,1]. The CNN model is created using TensorFlow and trained on the training set. The training is monitored using validation data, and early stopping is employed to prevent overfitting. After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set, and accuracy is reported.
### Critical Findings
 The training process revealed promising results as both training and validation accuracies consistently increased over epochs, indicating effective learning and generalization. The training and validation loss demonstrated a steady decrease, highlighting the model's ability to make more accurate predictions. The implemented early stopping mechanism helped prevent overfitting by monitoring the validation loss, ensuring that the model did not compromise its performance on unseen data. The final evaluation on the test set yielded a commendable accuracy, affirming the model's proficiency in classifying celebrity images.
